      <p>
        They say I look like I don’t care. That’s true — until I do.<br>
        Reticent. Book-fed. Ghost-mode on most days.<br>
        Stoic by choice, introvert by nature.<br>
        Gangster vibes? Maybe. But my war is inside.<br>
        I read Aurelius more than I talk. I feel Sherif more than I tweet.<br>
        I move in the direction of silence... and strength.<br>
        I speak masculinity, not perform it.

    <h2>EDUCATION??</h2>
    <p>
      By the way… I do love education. <br>
      📘 I kinda drive calculus crazy sometimes.<br>
      💻 I code quietly — but my builds don’t whisper.<br>
      🎓 Science & Technology? Yeah... it’s part of my silence.<br>
      Heard of Albert Einsten?? Can i be HIM sometime? 🤔, kidding i'm fond of HIM, he's real GOAT right?<br>

    <h2>📚 Stoic State of Mind 🤔</h2>
    <p>
      A stoic in progress.<br>
      A lover of quiet mornings and deep books.<br>
      I collect quotes, question everything, and vibe with ancient wisdom more than trends.<br>
      Life’s a puzzle — and I just might solve it with philosophy and good coffee.
